Reverse Engineering the Simplera Sync rtCGM Sensor


## About Simplera Sync
Simplera sync is a real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) sensor that works with the 780G pump. Connecting the sensor to the pump enables the activation of the closed-loop system (SmartGuard), which automatically calculates and delivers basal insulin as well as any necessary corrections.

## Why?
I don't like it when companies force me to use only their product and/or ecosystem, especially when the product is overpriced for what it offers. The argument that the price reflects the cost of research, studies, and future development does not convince me at allâ€”especially since other companies producing rtCGM systems have proven that it can be done better and cheaper.

## Main goals
- Understanding the Bluetooth protocol
- Enabling the connection of a different rtCGM
- Extending the sensor's lifespan
